# finite-automata

*In-Progress* : Working on this while taking a class on Automata and Formal Languages; ideally, one would be able to convert from an NFA to a DFA, and I want to also add epsilon-NFAs.

## Project Scope

- Deterministic Finite Automata - *Added*
- Nondeterministic Finite Automata - *Planned*
- Epsilon-transition Nondeterministic Finite Automata - *Planned* 

A goal is to implement everything as close to their formal definitions as possible.

- Read/Write to text files to save/load Automata - *Planned*
- REPL setup - *Planned*

## Requirements

- Python 3

As of right now, one can just make a DFA in ``DFA.py`` and test it out (there is an example), but ideally there will be a REPL system in place.
